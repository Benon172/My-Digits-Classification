Determining the Optimal Model and Hyperparameters for classifying Sklearn's Digits dataset

This is my attempt at finding the best performining classifier along with the parameters for Sklearn's digits dataset. I will continuosly improve the model(s) over time, be it through adding classifiers or optimizing the exiting one(s)
